This project is created using LSMinimalApi template.

Project template implements LSCore ecosystem used to build APIs fast and easy.

To start the project you need to update `appsettings.json` in both `.DbMigrations` and `.Api` projects.
After you have done so, run EF update database script from `.DbMigrations` project folder, and it will create database with `Users` table.

After this is done, you can run `.Api` project and start developing.
